RELEASE NOTES:
1.1.3 December 2015
*** API CHANGE *** As described below, some breaking changes have been
   introduced to the API. This may require changes to existing code.
   
  - Changed IO and FileIO classes. Subclasses of IO are now responsible for
    making IO::open() and IO::close() thread safe. This will only affect
	derived sub-classes of IO. See the file lidar/IO.h for more information.
  - Added a new GPS time channel. Replaced the CHANNEL_NAME_GPSTime macro
    with CHANNEL_NAME_GPSTime_Week and added CHANNEL_NAME_GPSTime_Adjusted.
	GPSTIme_Week is the number of seconds since midnight Sunday.
	GPSTime_Adjusted is the satellite GPS Time minus 1 x 10^9.

                                    1.0, 
                                    reader->getChannelInfo(), 
                                    reader->getNumChannels(), 
                                    NULL);
